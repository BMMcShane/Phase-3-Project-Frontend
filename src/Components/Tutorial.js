                Meowdy there pardner!
                <br/>
                Allow me to welcome yous to the Grand 'ole MewMew's Mill. I'm MewMew, the <em>paw</em>-prietor, 
                and I got a few tips fer you if yer lookin to takeover one 'a mah farms.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                First off, if yer new here, yer gonna want to go ahead and get started growin' some grass. 
                "Why grass?" You might ask... <em>*chuckles*</em> well I'll tell you: 'Ole MewMew has been engagin in them there 'aggressively 
                monopolistic tactics', and thanks to the work of mah many enforcers, 
                I am in complete control the grass market. <br/>
                Anyone lookin to  even <em>own</em> grass has to come 'ta me first, and that makes me the big bucks. 
                Now, I know what you'll say, "Is that legal?", well let me tell ya something, all things are legal when 
                yer the one bankrollin the lawmakers. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Anyways, lets get back ta farmin. To plant sumthin, all you gotta do is have the plant you want 'ta grow selected in 
                your <b><em>PLANTOPEDIA</em></b>, and then you click the plot you want ta grow on. After yous plant that grass, yer gonna have to 
                wait for it to grow, shouldn't be too long. You'll likely be able to tell that yer plant is done grown when 
                the 'lil fella starts to jiggle. Once thats done, all ya gotta do is click the plant to harvest it. 
                Finally, ya give all those crops 'ta me, and fer each harvest ya bring in I'll be rewardin yous generously.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But yous didn't come to here to just grow <em>grass</em>, I see <b>ambition</b> in those eyes. If yer lookin to 
                make the big bucks, then I highly reconmmend you take all those coins I'll be givin ya, and then reinvest 'em inta 
                yer ability to grow crops. Over in the <b><em>SHOPPE</em></b>, yous can spend yer coins buyin 
                all sorts 'a upgrades, like unlockin new plants you can grow, makin yer farm bigger, or gettin better tools. Ya can keep track of all yer junk over in the <b><em>WALLET</em></b>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                With that, yous should know just about all there is 'ta running a good farm, but befer I leave ya, 
                I have two little bits of advice. First, never try 'ta harvest a succulent befer its done growin, and second, 
                 <b><u>never fergit</u></b> that 'Ole MewMew <b><em>ALWAYS</em></b> gets his cut.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Good luck, and remember to try and have fun here in
                <br/>
